# P-PAD
Reinforcement learning on [Puzzle & Dragons](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.gungho.padEN).

The project is still evolving but currently contains the following components:
* OpenAI Gym like environment.
* Tensorflow/Keras for the agent.
* Training data generation.
* Basic visualization.

### Random sampling
